#Summary
Currently I am working as an Application Support Analyst at EPAM Systems and responsible for:
- Analysis of performance reports, identify root causes and make propositions to development and infrastructure teams 
- Issues investigation and on-call support for high environments (QED, HotProd, PROD) and provide mitigation instructions to development and infrastructure teams. Includes: monitoring of infrastructure (Splunk, internal tools), creation of memory/DB/network dumps, checking server and application's logs, etc. 
- Measuring environment's capacity (capacity reporting)
I want to change my professional area and beacome a developer, because coding was always interesting for me. I coudn't decide what kind of programming language to choose, but finally I opted for javascript as I had html coding experience on my past project. I think that the ability of coding can provide you with the ability of the creation something amazing. Unfortunately, at the moment I have no code examples, but I hope that I fix it by achieving my goal to become a developer.
